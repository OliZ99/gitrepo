THIS IS THE TESTING REPO-alice

# TODO
1. how to sync main and master branch in github-manually
2. how to manage the code in local file system and remote repo
  - If the remote repo has been updated, and I haven't pull the latest version to local git repo
  - I already modified/added files in local repo, I want to commit and push to remote
